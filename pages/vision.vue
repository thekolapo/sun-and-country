        The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa
        butter is the key. They key is to have every key, the key to open every
        door. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple,
        you’ve got to make it. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make
        history, simple, you’ve got to make it. Stay focused. Stay focused. Fan
        luv. Special cloth alert. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple.
        They will try to close the door on you, just open it.

        Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest
        to you that want to see you fail. Congratulations, you played yourself.
        I’m up to something. Lion! Another one. The key is to enjoy life,
        because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t
        want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. I told you all this
        before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt
        water, the healing, salt water is the healing. You see that bamboo
        behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless
        up.

        Eliptical talk. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to
        enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t
        want you to smile. We don’t see them, we will never see them. Celebrate
        success right, the only way, apple. The key is to drink coconut, fresh
        coconut, trust me. We the best. A major key, never panic. Don’t panic,
        when it gets crazy and rough, don’t panic, stay calm.

        They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I
        can. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. Lion! Egg whites,
        turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat
        our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. Hammock talk come
        soon. I’m up to something. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and
        I know the key to success. Congratulations, you played yourself.
        Eliptical talk. The key to more success is to get a massage once a week,
        very important, major key, cloth talk.
